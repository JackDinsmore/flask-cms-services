This is a repository set up by Jack Dinsmore (jtdinsmo). Initially, it contained a test of flask pulled from a tutorial he found online.

The purpose of this repository is to hold code to be launched on a GCP Kubernetes Cluster which will run GPU and eventually TPU machine learning algorithms as a service. We will start with MNIST, then move on to Resnet-50. 

These files will be mapped to a Docker image and launched on one of these clusters using the tutorial provided at https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart and several other related GKE tutorial pages.
